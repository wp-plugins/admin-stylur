== Description ==

Customize your WordPress Dashboard and admin login via a single CSS file that can be edited right from your dashboard. Read more about the customization of your admin via the WordPress Codex(http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Admin_Themes). Features include setting the login image to the URL of your blogsetting and setting the title attribute to your blog's name. Also provided is a logo uploader (found under the “Appearance” dashboard menu item) to swap the default WordPress logo on all login screens.

NOTE:
Layout uses [flexbox](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox). Error messages use [transforms](http://caniuse.com/#search=transforms), [transitions](http://caniuse.com/#search=transitions) and [animations](http://caniuse.com/#search=animations). Vendor prefixes supplied where required. Consider yourself warned.

== Installation ==

1. download the plugin
2. upload to your “plugins” directory
3. celebrate good times.

Your current version is wack. Don't worry though because if you update me everything will be just fine even if you think you have an old version of WordPress. I promise I won't hurt you…pinky swear.
