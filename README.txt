== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where's the custom logo uploader located? =
You'll find the logo uploader under WordPress' “Appearance” menu item located on your admin dashboard. The sub-item option is titled “admin-stylur.”

= Where are the custom styles at dawg? =
Go to the “plugins” menu via your dashboard and select the admin-stylur's “edit” link.

= So you're just giving me a plain old CSS file? =
Sort of. It's a list of hooks and such for your convenience w/some general login view cleanup cause I never like the way it looks.

= What is the airspeed velocity of a swallow? =
Pretty fast.
